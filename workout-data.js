// WORKOUT DATA: Modern ES6 module for exercise definitions
// Structure: Export workout data for three days with exercise details
// Include: Exercise names, sets, reps, video URLs, exercise types
// Pattern: Use modern JavaScript object/array structures
// Each workout day should have exercises with proper metadata

export const workoutData = {
    // Let Copilot generate your workout structure
};
